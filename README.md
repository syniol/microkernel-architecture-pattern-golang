# Microkernel Architecture in Golang
This example intent to demonstrate Microkernel Architecture using Golang. I created and formatted this project in 
form of agile where overview, acceptance criteria, and requirement should clearly state the objective of demo code.

There are generally two ways to approach this design, internal components (plugins) or create separate repository and 
maintain components as a dependency as illustrated in diagram below.

## How to Run Demo
