# Microkernel Architecture in Golang
This example intent to demonstrate Microkernel Architecture using Golang. I created and order this project in form of 
agile where overview, acceptance criteria, and requirement should clearly state the objective of demo code. 

There are generally two ways to approach this design, internal components (plugins) or create separate repository and 
maintain components as a dependency as illustrated in diagram below.
